# Lifecycle-Anchored VM Morphology Taxonomy for Rightsizing

## üìå Overview
Cloud platforms often suffer from **inefficient VM provisioning** and **high churn of short-lived instances**, leading to wasted resources and higher costs.  
This project introduces a **lifecycle-anchored morphology taxonomy** for Virtual Machines (VMs) using **minimal telemetry** (aggregate CPU statistics and lifecycle metadata).  

We combine **unsupervised clustering** (Gaussian Mixture Models) with **supervised predictive models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) to:
- Discover VM **morphologies** (e.g., steady baseline, bursty survivors, ephemeral spikes).
- Predict **short-lived VMs** with high recall.
- Propose **operational policies** for cloud resource rightsizing.

## üöÄ Features
- **Lightweight Feature Set**: Uses only average, p95, max CPU, and VM lifetime.  
- **Clustering (GMM)**: Identifies distinct VM workload morphologies.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Classifies short-lived VMs using Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression.  
- **Evaluation**: High recall for detecting ephemeral workloads.  
- **Operational Decision Framework**: Maps VM types to actionable rightsizing policies.

## üìä Results
- **Morphology Discovery**: Identified 4‚Äì6 distinct VM categories.  
- **Classification**:  
  - Logistic Regression ‚Üí Recall: ~82%  
  - Random Forest ‚Üí Recall: ~92%  
  - XGBoost ‚Üí Recall: ~90%  
- **Key Insight**: Tree-based models achieve highest recall, crucial for catching ephemeral VMs.  
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Clusters mapped to inefficiency vs. short-lived rates for rightsizing decisions.
